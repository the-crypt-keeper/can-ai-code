This will be used to keep track of the number of times each character appears in `str`.\n* Then, we iterate over each character in `str` using a `for char in str:` loop. For each character, if it's the sub-string we're looking for (`substr`), we increment the count by 1. We store the result in the `count` dictionary with the current character as the key.\n* After iterating over all characters in `str`, we return the sum of all the values in `count`. This will give us the total number of occurrences of the sub-string `substr` in `str`.\nFor example, if you call `substr_count(\"hello\", \"lo\")` it would return 2, because the string \"lo\" appears twice in the input string \"hello\".\nI hope this helps!

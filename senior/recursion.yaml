FlattenZeroShot:
    Signature: "flatten(obj)"
    Input: "with an object `obj` input"
    Output: |-
      returns a flat version of obj according to the following rules:

      - Keys who's values are simple types are left unmodified
      - Keys that are objects are merged into the parent, their names seperated with a .
      - Keys that are lists are merged into the parent, their names suffixed with . and the entry number

      Apply these rules recursively, the output object should contain only primitive types at the end.
